# Advance Edge Website (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This repository contains the Advance Edge website built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Node.js and npm.

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

- Local preview: `http://localhost:8080/`
- If you see `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on `8081`, use `8080` instead.

## Recent Updates

- Mobile header back arrow on small screens to navigate back (fallback to `/`).
- Mobile menu stability: overlay rendered via portal (`document.body`) and corrected stacking context to prevent clipping after scroll.
- "Book a Call" CTAs on Home now route directly to `/contact` using `Link`.

## Key Files

- `src/components/Header.tsx`: Mobile menu, back arrow, header behavior on scroll.
- `src/pages/Home.tsx`: Home page hero and CTAs linking to Contact.

## How to Test

- Open `http://localhost:8080/`.
- On mobile view:
  - Scroll down â‰¥25% and open the hamburger menu; the overlay should fully cover the screen.
  - Tap the back arrow to navigate back; if no history, it goes to `/`.
  - Tap any "Book a Call" CTA on Home; it should route to `/contact`.

## Troubleshooting

- If assets momentarily show `ERR_ABORTED` during hot reload, wait a moment; these are transient during dependency optimization.
- Ensure the dev server is running (`npm run dev`) and that you are visiting `http://localhost:8080/`.
